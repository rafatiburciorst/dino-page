# My Page Project

This project is built using Deno, Vite, and Qwik. It serves as a template for building modern web applications with these technologies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Deno](https://deno.land/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rafatiburciorst/dino-page.git
    cd my-page
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and you can view your application at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production build of your application.

### Linting

To lint your code, run:

```sh
npm run lint
```

This will run ESLint on your codebase to ensure code quality and consistency.
